# Home Assistant configuration

My Home Assistant (https://home-assistant.io) configuration files and screenshots.


## What's special?

### Automation based on power consumption

The Max Hauri maxSMART Power Station can be used to read power consumption and to control socket states. This allows to automatically turn off power for devices that are in standby and which Home Assistant knows are not in use anymore. This is determined by the state of binary switches ('Watch movie', 'Listen to music' etc.).
Another possibility is to automatically switch the source of the amplifier to 'Phono' if the turntable is using energy.
